/**
 * Whitelist of translation namespaces consumed by client-rendered components.
 *
 * The Provider's `messages` prop becomes part of the RSC payload on every page
 * load. Keeping it narrow (vs. shipping the full messages file) is a bundle-size
 * win. Server components read from the messages file directly via
 * `getTranslations`, so they do NOT need to be listed here.
 *
 * Drift prevention: `test/i18n-client-namespaces.test.ts` scans the repo for
 * every `useTranslations('X')` call in client-rendered files and fails CI if a
 * namespace is missing from these lists. Update both places together.
