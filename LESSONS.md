Repo-specific gotchas worth sharing. Read this during research on any task here.

## Never `waitUntil: "networkidle"` in an e2e against a deployed build

`load_more_with_filters.spec.ts` did `page.goto(..., { waitUntil: "networkidle" })`. Locally it passed; against the Vercel preview it timed out `page.goto` at 45s **every** retry, hard-failing the required E2E gate and blocking every develop PR — even a docs-only one. The cause isn't the test's data or mocks (that spec fully mocks `/api/events`): analytics, ads and Sentry keep the network busy on a deployed build, so "networkidle" (500ms of silence) never fires. Use `waitUntil: "domcontentloaded"` plus an explicit auto-waiting assertion for the element you need (`expect(getByTestId(...))`), the way `home.flow.spec.ts` does reliably. For a mid-test settle after an action, bound it: `page.waitForLoadState("networkidle", { timeout: 5000 }).catch(() => {})`, never an unbounded wait. Grep `e2e/` for `networkidle` before trusting the gate.

## A test that skips on its own failure mode is worse than no test

The image-proxy e2e tests skipped on any 502 (`test.skip("Test image service unavailable")`). When the dispatcher broke and 502'd every image, the suite read it as a flaky upstream and shipped green — for weeks (the May 2026 autoSelectFamily regression). If a test exists to catch failure X, it must **fail** on X, never skip. Retry to absorb genuine flakiness, then fail once retries are exhausted. Before trusting a green e2e run, grep for `if (status >= 500) test.skip` shapes.

## `yarn build` does NOT run `prebuild`

Yarn 4 (Berry) dropped automatic `pre*`/`post*` lifecycle scripts — npm runs them, Yarn doesn't. `prebuild` generates `public/sw.js` and `public/robots.txt`, both gitignored. Every deploy path must invoke it explicitly: the Dockerfile/Coolify and CI already do; Vercel needs the `vercel.json` `buildCommand` (`yarn prebuild && yarn build`). The env-specific builds (`build:development|staging|production`) already chain prebuild. A bare `yarn build` ships without the service worker or robots.txt.

## Vercel previews are a preview, not production

Production runs on Coolify/Docker/Node 22; Vercel previews are a different runtime. Sharp is bundled via the Dockerfile and excluded on Vercel — the Sharp e2e test self-skips on `*.vercel.app`. Vercel previews also sit behind a 401 protection wall, so automated probes need the `x-vercel-protection-bypass` secret. A green Vercel preview does not prove production works; gate promotion to `main` on the Coolify/Docker path.

## Image-proxy/dispatcher bugs only surface through a real socket

`buildPinnedDnsDispatcher`'s `lookup` callback runs only when undici opens a real connection — autoSelectFamily (Happy Eyeballs, default since Node 20) calls it with `{ all: true }` and expects an array of records. Mocked-fetch unit tests never reach it. `test/pinned-dns-dispatcher.test.ts` fetches through a loopback server to exercise the real path; keep that style for any proxy or dispatcher change.

That real-socket design has a cost: it's a real HTTP server on a real (ephemeral) port, so it can flake under CPU/port contention rather than a code bug. It failed once in `yarn test --run` right after a `git push` (2213/2215) while a dev server and browser automation were still running in the background, then passed 3/3 in isolation and 2215/2215 once those processes were killed. Before "fixing" a failure here, rule out background load (`next dev`, headless browsers, other test runs) rather than touching the dispatcher code.

## Back-merge main hotfixes into develop the same day

main and develop diverge. A fix that lands directly on main (a hotfix) does not reach develop on its own, so develop can re-ship a bug main already fixed — and merging develop→main can even revert main's fix. This caused the Jun 11 2026 incident: `097e1275 fix(cache): scope Redis entries by build id` sat on main for weeks while develop kept the broken handler. The `branch-drift` CI workflow flags when main is ahead of develop on infra files (`cache-handler.mjs`, `next.config.js`, `Dockerfile`, `proxy.ts`). When you see that warning, back-merge before promoting.

## The Redis cacheHandler is self-hosted-only — and HTTP 200 ≠ rendered

`next.config.js` enables the Redis `cacheHandler` only off-Vercel (`isVercel ? {} : { cacheHandler }`). So localhost and Vercel can never reproduce cache-handler bugs; only Coolify (persistent Redis across deploys) can. Keys are scoped by `buildId` so a new build never reads a previous build's prerendered shell — a stale shell makes React's resume mismatch (`Expected the resume to render ...`), fall back to client rendering, and emit HTML with no SSR `<title>`/description/canonical. The page still returns 200, so assert metadata in the **raw** HTML, not the status code. See [docs/incidents/2026-06-11-coolify-redis-stale-prerender.md](docs/incidents/2026-06-11-coolify-redis-stale-prerender.md).

## Don't assert data-conditional UI in an e2e against uncontrolled live data

`place-page-explore-nav.spec.ts` asserted the place explore nav on `/barcelona` against whatever the backend held. Once #313 gated that nav on a place having `>= SITEMAP_MIN_EVENTS_FOR_EXPANSION` events, the e2e broke in any test-data environment (a place can legitimately fall below the threshold) and rotted as test events aged past "upcoming". A page that fetches its gating data **server-side** can't be made deterministic with Playwright route interception either (that only mocks browser requests). Test such logic at the layer that owns its inputs: a component test with controlled props (see `test/components/ui/placePageExploreNav.test.tsx`). Reserve e2e for critical journeys against **seeded** data.

## Never lower preview/test-env fidelity to make a test pass

It's tempting to drop a threshold (e.g. `SITEMAP_MIN_EVENTS_FOR_EXPANSION`) or relax gating in non-prod so a flaky test goes green. Don't: that makes the preview behave differently from production, which is the exact parity gap that caused the cache and image-proxy incidents. Fix the mis-layered test, not the environment. Environment parity is the asset.

## Places API cost is controlled in three layers — two of them are NOT in this repo

`/api/places/nearby` (Google `searchNearby`, billed per request) has its cost held down by three controls, and only the first lives in git:

1. **Code** — `lib/cache/redis-client.ts` + `lib/places/nearby-cache-key.ts` cache results in Redis keyed by `~1.1km-snapped` coordinates. This is a **separate Redis layer from `cache-handler.mjs`** on purpose: the Next handler scopes keys by `buildId` and wipes them every deploy, which is wrong for data that should outlive deploys. The app cache is deploy-independent (12h TTL) and fails open.
2. **Cloudflare WAF** (dashboard, zone `esdeveniments.cat`) — managed-challenge for SG/JP/CN bot traffic + a per-IP rate-limit on the endpoint.
3. **GCP quota** (`places.googleapis.com/SearchNearbyRequest`, project `esdeveniments-3`) — **50/day** consumer override. This is the hard ceiling. The €10 "budget" is only an alert, never a cap.

So if restaurants suddenly stop showing, or a request 429s, the cause may be the WAF or the quota — not the code. See [docs/incidents/2026-06-26-places-api-cost.md](docs/incidents/2026-06-26-places-api-cost.md).

## Never block DE / Hetzner / datacenter ASNs at the Cloudflare edge — that's the own origin

~40% of Cloudflare traffic shows country **DE** hitting `api.esdeveniments.cat` on SSR data paths (`/api/events`, `/api/places/regions/options`, …). That is **not** a bot — it's the Coolify box on **Hetzner** (ASN 24940, Germany) calling its own backend through Cloudflare on every render. A disabled "block non-ES" WAF rule already exists from a past attempt, and a Cloudflare AI assistant will recommend challenging datacenter ASNs (incl. 24940 / AWS). Applying either takes down SSR. Use *managed challenge* on named bot-source countries (SG/JP/CN), never *block* by geography/ASN, and always verify origin egress before any country/ASN edge rule.

## Behind Coolify/Traefik, `request.nextUrl.origin` is the container's internal bind

In a route handler on the self-hosted box, `request.nextUrl.origin` (and `request.url`) is `https://0.0.0.0:3000`, **not** the public host — Next sees the internal bind, not what the browser used. This silently broke the Logto OIDC `redirect_uri` on the first preview deploy: it pointed at `0.0.0.0:3000/api/auth/callback`, which the IdP rejects (and tests on localhost never caught it, because there the bind *is* the public origin). Curiously, the same value is correct inside `proxy.ts` (middleware sees the real host), so the bug only bites route handlers.

Rule: any externally-facing URL built in a route handler (OAuth redirect URIs, post-logout URIs, absolute links in emails/webhooks) must derive the origin from `x-forwarded-host` / `x-forwarded-proto`, not `nextUrl.origin`. Use `getRequestOrigin()` in `lib/auth/logto.ts`. It's safe to trust the forwarded headers because the proxy overwrites client-supplied ones, and Logto's exact-match redirect allowlist is the real gate. This can only be caught against a real proxied deployment — the `prod-arch-smoke` localhost build can't see it; the post-deploy smoke in `deploy-coolify.yml` asserts the deployed sign-in `redirect_uri` matches `DEPLOY_URL`.

## The service worker must never cache `/api/auth/*` — a stale cache outlives logout

Logout looked broken on the first Logto preview: after sign-out the navbar stayed logged-in and `/api/auth/me` kept returning 200 with the user. The cookies were actually cleared (a `curl` and a `?cb=` cache-buster both returned 401) — the lie was in the **service worker**. The catch-all `/api/` `StaleWhileRevalidate` route in `public/sw-template.js` cached `/api/auth/me`; it only gates on status 200 and ignores the route's `Cache-Control: no-store` (the `respectCacheControlPlugin` is wired into the pages cache, not the API cache). So the SW served the logged-in response from before logout. `/api/auth/sign-out` likewise landed in the pages cache as a navigation. Note `cache: 'no-store'` on a `fetch` does NOT bypass the SW — that flag only touches the HTTP cache, so the symptom survives a hard fetch and only `curl` (no SW) tells the truth.

Fix: a `NetworkOnly` route for `/api/auth/*` registered **before** the navigation and catch-all `/api/` routes (Workbox is first-match-wins). Any future auth-state or per-user endpoint needs the same treatment — never let it fall into a caching strategy. `test/service-worker.test.ts` asserts the auth route exists and is ordered before the catch-all. Generated `public/sw.js` is gitignored; edit the template and run `yarn prebuild`.

**Deploying the fix to existing users — the SW lifecycle trap (2026-07-26):** Adding `NetworkOnly` alone is not enough. Workbox-managed caches invalidate on a `suffix` bump or `cleanupOutdatedCaches()`, but the catch-all `/api/` route uses a **literal** `cacheName: "esdeveniments-local-api-cache"` outside Workbox's rename system, so the stale `/api/auth/me` 200 survives a suffix bump. Worse, Workbox's `CacheableResponsePlugin({ statuses: [0, 200] })` means an in-flight SWR update with a 401 will *not* overwrite the cached 200 — the SW keeps serving the pre-logout response until that exact cache key is wiped. Without `self.skipWaiting()` on `install`, the new SW stays in `WAITING` until every tab of the app closes, so any SW-side fix silently fails to reach users that already have the broken SW installed.

Three things go together: (1) `self.addEventListener("install", () => self.skipWaiting())` so the new SW forces a takeover the moment it installs; (2) bump `suffix: "v4"` → `"v5"` so precache/runtime caches are renamed and `cleanupOutdatedCaches` prunes them; (3) `await caches.delete("esdeveniments-local-api-cache")` inside the `activate` handler so the hardcoded poison cache is explicitly purged. Skip any one and the bug returns.

## The CSRF origin allowlist makes `/api/favorites` a localhost-only false green

The favorites POST is CSRF-guarded by an origin allowlist that includes `localhost:3000` in dev. So on localhost the write passes; it only **403s on a non-localhost / non-www host** — i.e. a Coolify PR preview or staging. Same shape as the proxy-origin bug: the environment that's convenient to test on is exactly the one that can't reproduce the failure. Test any origin/CSRF-gated write (favorites, and future authed mutations) on the Coolify preview, and if a POST 403s only off-localhost, suspect the allowlist host set, not the client. Manual runbook: `docs/logto-auth-setup.md`.

## `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` are baked at build (from GitHub) — not read from Coolify at runtime

The prebuilt-image deploy (PR #371) builds the image in GitHub Actions and runs it in Coolify, so env vars split in two: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` are inlined **at build** from the **GitHub** environment secrets; runtime secrets (`HMAC_SECRET`, `REDIS_URL`, `STRIPE_*`, …) are read **at runtime** from **Coolify**. The `getApiUrl`/`getApiOrigin` "indirect lookup" in `utils/api-helpers.ts` was meant to keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` runtime-readable, but it does **not** — Turbopack still inlines it (grep `/app/.next/server` and you'll find literal copies). So for a Docker-Image app the Coolify `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are dead; GitHub's are authoritative.

On 2026-06-27 the GitHub `staging` secret `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was missing the `/api` suffix → every fetch hit `/events` (→ 500) → `fetchEventsExternal` swallowed it into an empty list → blank events with HTTP 200 and **no logs** (`removeConsole` had stripped the error; now fixed to keep `console.error`). The Coolify-built (dockerfile) staging app was fine because its build bakes Coolify's own correct value, which hid the mismatch. Rules: GitHub secrets are the source of truth for `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` in image builds; `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` must include `/api` (backend serves `/api/events`); the prod `:main` build uses **repo-level** secrets (there is no `production` GH environment) so verify `https://api.esdeveniments.cat/api` before cutover; confirm a baked value with `docker exec <c> sh -c "grep -rhoE 'https://api[a-zA-Z0-9._/-]*' /app/.next/server | sort -u"`. The post-deploy smoke test now asserts `/api/events` returns data so this can't ship silently again. See [docs/ci-build-push-migration.md](docs/ci-build-push-migration.md).

## Cloudflare Zaraz runs zone-wide — a Google tag there fires on every host, bypassing app gating

On 2026-08-18 the prod GA4 property (`G-1F86ZBKSJ0`) showed `staging.esdeveniments.cat` and `coolify.esdeveniments.cat` traffic. The app was innocent — `app/GoogleScripts.tsx` gates gtag/Ads behind an `isProductionHost` allowlist. The source was **Cloudflare Zaraz**: the zone-level tag manager injects its loader into every hostname in the `esdeveniments.cat` zone and carried a GA4 integration with the prod measurement ID, so it fired `stats.g.doubleclick.net/g/collect?t=dc&tid=G-1F86ZBKSJ0` on staging and on the Coolify dashboard itself. Anything that runs at the CDN/zone level (Zaraz, Workers, edge injections) executes *outside* the app and cannot be stopped by app-side host gating. When "foreign traffic in GA" appears, check what Cloudflare injects — and probe with a live browser that logs network requests: `curl`/grep of the served HTML misses Zaraz because the loader is UA-gated/inline. Fix = remove the GA4/Ads integration from Zaraz (the app already implements GA4 + Ads + Consent Mode v2 natively); detect with the nightly `no-google-tracking` E2E against the deployed staging host; clean up with a GA4 hostname data filter. See [docs/incidents/2026-08-18-zaraz-zone-wide-google-tags.md](docs/incidents/2026-08-18-zaraz-zone-wide-google-tags.md).

## Cutting a Coolify app to Docker Image: `BUILD_VERSION` survives a naive env copy

When standing up the new Docker Image apps (2026-07-03, both staging and prod),
copying env vars over from the old Dockerfile app also copied `BUILD_VERSION` —
no copy method excludes it automatically. Left in place, it shadows the value
the image bakes at build time and silently breaks the `/api/health` version
check `deploy-coolify.yml` polls after every deploy (the deploy job then times
out waiting for a SHA that never appears, even though the container is
actually healthy). After any env-var copy onto a Docker Image app, check for
and delete `BUILD_VERSION` before wiring in the CI webhook. See
[docs/ci-build-push-migration.md](docs/ci-build-push-migration.md).

Also: Coolify's "Deploy Webhook" is a distinct URL from the app's public FQDN
and from the "Manual Git Webhooks" section on the same page — grab it from the
top of the app's Webhooks tab, it needs the `Authorization: Bearer` header the
same way `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`/`_STAGING` are consumed in the workflow.

## A duplicate personal Vercel project posts a second preview status that can block the E2E gate

There are two Vercel projects wired to this GitHub repo: the **team** one (`esdeveniments` scope, the correct one — its previews are opened by `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`) and a leftover **personal** duplicate (`albertolives-projects` scope, auth-protected, the bypass secret does not open it). Both build every commit and both post a `success` status to the **same** `vercel[bot]` GitHub deployment, about a second apart. The personal status lands last, so it's the newest.

The E2E "Wait for Vercel preview" step must use the **team** preview, never the personal one. It read statuses with `per_page=1` and inspected only `.[0]` (newest) — always the personal URL — rejected it as an unexpected scope, and timed out at 900s without ever looking at the team status behind it. This wasn't flaky: it blocked *every* PR deterministically once #388 added the fail-closed scope filter. Fix (this PR): fetch `per_page=20` and scan **all** success statuses for the one whose host ends with `-esdeveniments.vercel.app`. The real cleanup is to disconnect the personal project's Git integration in Vercel so it stops building/posting at all; until then the CI scan is the safety net. If the team scope/domain ever moves, update `EXPECTED_PREVIEW_HOST_SUFFIX` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## PR review-loop must wait for AI bot re-reviews to settle before declaring convergence
After a push that should re-trigger bots, the GitHub review-thread stream
arrives over a few minutes (Copilot + CodeRabbit + Greptile + Cubic + Gemini
each have their own polling cadence). A single `gh api graphql` filtered
list at time T is conclusive evidence of *that instant*, not the eventual
stable state. Round 2 on PR #426 fetched 1 unresolved thread and declared
convergence; another 12 landed within ten minutes, including two P1
regressions the same PR's round-1 commit had introduced. Rule: poll twice,
≥ 4 min apart, and only call convergence when `totalCount` is stable AND
`unresolved == 0` (or new threads are declines of previously-declined
items). See `docs/incidents/2026-07-26-pr-review-loop-missed-threads.md`.

## An enrichment wrapper that `return null`s on backend 401 masks every authenticated-session regression
`lib/auth/enrichment.ts.enrichWithBackendProfile` used to call
`getAuthenticatedUserExternal(accessToken)` and silently `return user` on any
failure — so when the backend rejected the Bearer with 401 (audience
mismatch, JWKS not imported in preprod, etc.), the session *looked* valid
because the id_token was itself correct. The navbar then rendered with an
empty `username` (`getProfileSlug(user) => ""`) and the profile menu item
disappeared. Users reported "I can't see my profile in the menu" with no
breadcrumb to the actual cause. Rule of thumb: any "best-effort" wrapper
that can silently down-grade to a less-privileged user view MUST surface the
failure mode on the result (here: `profileEnrichmentFailed: "auth" | "transient"`)
so the UI can render an honest warning. Also: log JWT `iss`/`aud`/`exp` claim
hints at the rejection site so the next log scrape immediately tells you
whether the audience is wrong, the issuer is wrong, or the JWT expired —
don't redact everything, just enough PII to stay safe.

## `AuthProvider`'s client session is hydrated once — nothing keeps it in sync

`lib/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` fetches `/api/auth/me` exactly once, in a
`useEffect` on mount, and caches the result in React state for the tab's
lifetime. `useAuth().user` never updates on its own again. A plan to fix the
profile-completion onboarding (`/perfil/edita`, avatar upload) originally
assumed `router.push()` / `router.refresh()` after a successful `PATCH
/api/users/me/profile` would be enough to reflect the new
`profileCompleted`/`username`/`avatarUrl` — it isn't: `router.refresh()`
only re-runs Server Component data fetching, and `AuthProvider` sits above
the navigating route segment so it never remounts. Without an explicit
resync, the `/publica` profile-completion gate would re-check a stale
`false` even after a successful save. Fix: `AuthProvider` now exposes
`refetchUser(): Promise<void>` (extracted the mount-time fetch into a
reusable `load()` so both paths share the retry/abort logic) — any client
mutation that changes session-derived fields (profile PATCH, avatar
upload/remove) must call it explicitly. `router.refresh()` alone is not
enough for anything read from `useAuth()`.

## The profile events endpoint takes `period=active|past`, not `status=upcoming|past`

`docs/plans/2026-07-30-profile-events-split.md` was drafted against a param
named `status`. Gerard's actual contract (confirmed 2026-07-30, live on PRE)
is `period`, required, lowercase, on both
`/api/users/{username}/events?period=active|past` and
`/api/users/me/favorites/events?period=active|past` (same spec, for the
future favourites split). `active` includes upcoming *and* in-progress
events; `past` sorts most-recent-first. `lib/api/users-external.ts`
`getUserEventsExternal` keeps `status: "upcoming" | "past"` as its own
parameter name (a domain word, matching `ProfileEventsSectionProps`) and
translates it to `period` at that one boundary — see `PERIOD_BY_STATUS`.
If a future endpoint needs the same split, translate at the API-layer
boundary rather than renaming the domain-level `status` everywhere it's
threaded through.

**Update, 2026-07-31:** the fix above only touched `users-external.ts`. It
missed `/api/users/me/favorites/events` — the plan's own finding #2 argued
favourites didn't need a `period` split yet, so `favorites-external.ts` was
left sending just `page`/`size`. The backend enforces `period` there too,
live, independent of whether the frontend favourites split has shipped:
every `listFavoriteEventsExternal` call was failing with
`HTTP 500 "Required request parameter 'period' ... is not present"`
(confirmed via Coolify staging logs), which `/api/favorites` turns into a
hardcoded 502, breaking `/preferits` and — because homepage cards never
pass `initialIsFavorite` (`components/ui/hybridEventsList/index.tsx`) and
rely entirely on the client fetch to `/api/favorites` to learn favorite
state — leaving homepage hearts stuck unfavorited on every fresh load.
There is no `period=all`; `listFavoriteEventsExternal` now fetches both
`active` and `past` and merges them, since `/preferits` needs both (display
+ `FavoritesAutoPrune`'s expired-favourite cleanup, PR #430) in one list.

`upcomingEventCount`/`pastEventCount` on `UserPublicResponseDTO`
(`lib/validation/user.ts`) are unconfirmed — still `.nullish()`, degrading to
a label-only tab until the backend starts sending them.
